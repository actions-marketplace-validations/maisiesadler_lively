# Example Outputs

The name of the file is the output format type.

If the file can't be viewed in the browser then there is a screenshot alongside the example.

E.g. `mermaidmd_md.png` is a screenshot of the mermaid diagram produced by `mermaidmd.md`.

With the exception of `yuml.svg` which is generated by the [yuml extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JaimeOlivares.yuml) from `yuml.yuml`.
